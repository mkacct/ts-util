# `ts-util`

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40mkacct%2Fts-util)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mkacct/ts-util)

This package is a collection of general utilities that would otherwise be duplicated across many TypeScript projects. (They are of course also usable in JavaScript, though there is no runtime type checking.)

See JSDoc comments (in source or using your IDE) for documentation.
